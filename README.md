# Decentralized Urban Foraging Network

## Project Description

The Decentralized Urban Foraging Network is a revolutionary blockchain-based platform that connects urban foragers with property owners who have forageable resources on their land. This smart contract system creates a sustainable ecosystem where property owners can monetize their natural resources while providing urban dwellers access to fresh, locally-sourced food through ethical foraging practices.

The platform tokenizes forageable food locations, allowing property owners to set access fees, harvest limits, and seasonal availability. Foragers can discover and access these locations by paying the required fees, while both parties earn platform tokens based on successful foraging activities. This creates an incentive structure that promotes sustainable harvesting and responsible urban food sourcing.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to transform urban food systems by creating a decentralized network that promotes sustainable foraging, supports local food security, and provides economic opportunities for property owners. We aim to bridge the gap between unused urban natural resources and the growing demand for locally-sourced, organic food while ensuring environmental sustainability through smart contract-enforced harvest limits.

The platform envisions a future where cities become more self-sufficient in food production, where every unused fruit tree, herb garden, or wild edible space can contribute to community food security while generating income for property owners. We believe this will reduce food waste, lower carbon footprints from food transportation, and strengthen community connections around local food systems.

## Key Features

- **Location Registration**: Property owners can register their forageable locations with detailed descriptions, coordinates, access fees, and harvest limits
- **Smart Payment System**: Automated fee collection and distribution between foragers and property owners
- **Seasonal Management**: Time-based controls for foraging seasons with flexible extension capabilities
- **Harvest Limit Enforcement**: Blockchain-enforced sustainability limits to prevent over-harvesting
- **Token Reward System**: Dual incentive structure rewarding both property owners (70%) and foragers (30%) with platform tokens
- **Session Tracking**: Comprehensive logging of all foraging activities for transparency and accountability
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Property owners can set and adjust access fees based on demand and resource availability

## Future Scope

The platform has extensive potential for growth and additional features:

- **Mobile App Integration**: GPS-based location discovery and real-time availability updates
- **IoT Sensor Integration**: Automated monitoring of harvest levels and resource availability
- **Quality Verification System**: Community-driven rating and review system for foraged locations
- **Marketplace Expansion**: Secondary market for trading location access rights and seasonal passes
- **Environmental Impact Tracking**: Carbon footprint calculations and environmental benefit metrics
- **Community Governance**: DAO implementation for platform governance and dispute resolution
- **Insurance Integration**: Smart contract-based insurance for property damage or liability issues
- **Seasonal Prediction AI**: Machine learning algorithms to predict optimal foraging times and yields
- **Supply Chain Integration**: Connections with local restaurants and food distributors
- **Educational Platform**: Integration with urban farming and sustainable living educational content
